# Privacy Policy for Offline CV

**Effective Date: February 19, 2026**

Offline CV ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information.

## 1. Information We Access
To provide the functionality of a professional resume builder, the app accesses the following information that you explicitly provide:
*   **Personal Information**: Name, job title, email address, phone number, physical address, professional summary, and social media links.
*   **Professional Details**: Work experience, education history, skills, certificates.
*   **Media**: A profile picture (from your camera or photo gallery) if you choose to add one.

## 2. Local Data Storage (Offline First)
**All information you enter into the app is stored locally on your device.** 
*   We do **NOT** collect, transmit, or store your personal data on external servers. 
*   The application operates entirely offline once installed.

## 3. Use of Permissions
The app requests specific permissions only when triggered by user actions (Just-in-Time):
*   **Camera Permission**: Used solely to allow you to take a profile photo within the app.
*   **Photo Library / Media Permission**: Used solely to allow you to select an existing photo from your device.
*   **Storage (Android 12 and below)**: Used to save the generated PDF and access photos on older Android versions. Newer versions use Scoped Storage or specific media permissions.

## 4. Privacy Policy for PDF Generation
When you generate a PDF, the app creates the file and prompts you to select a save location using the system file picker. We do not have access to your other files or folders except the one you specifically choose to save your PDF into.

## 5. Third-Party Sharing
We do **NOT** share any of your information with third parties. There are no tracking scripts, advertisements using personal data, or analytics packages that transmit your data.

## 6. Data Security
Since all data is stored on your device, the security of your data depends on the security of your mobile device. We recommend using device-level security features (like PIN or Biometrics) to protect your information.

## 7. Children's Privacy
Our app does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. Since no data is transmitted online, we comply with COPPA by design.

## 8. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app or on its store listing.
