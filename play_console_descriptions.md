**Why Choose Offline CV?**
We understand that your resume contains highly sensitive personal information. Other resume builders might require you to create an account or store your data in the cloud, exposing you to potential privacy risks. Offline CV is different. We respect your security by keeping everything local, ensuring peace of mind while you focus on landing your dream job.
